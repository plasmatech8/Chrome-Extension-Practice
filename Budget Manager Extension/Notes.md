#Budget Manager:

- Must be browser action
- Accept spending
- Display total spending
- Limit/notify if reached
- Option to reset total Limit


Uses Chrome storage API.
The options menu is a page you can open by right-clicking the icon.

Notifications do not seen to work for some reason. An alert was used instead, though it is probably a good idea to give permission to 'chrome.tabs' in order to put the alert on the main webpage (instead of extension).
